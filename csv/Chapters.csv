Raleigh has over 200 parks and Raleigh's Recreation and Cultural Resources Department's mission is to: establish and advance an equitable and inclusive community for all and to bring people to parks and parks to people!",15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,,,,
1,1,Black or African American and White Population Distributions in Raleigh Census Tracts,./media/White_and_Black_Populations_Plot.png,,,These plots display the distribution of White and Black or African American populations in Raleigh Census Tracts based on 2020 data,15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,,,,
2,2,Income Distribution in Raleigh Census Tracts,./media/Income_Plots.png,,,"These plots display total population per census tract and median income distribution based on overall median household income, White alone median household income, and Black or African American alone median household income in Raleigh Census Tracts in 2021",15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,,,,
3,3,Raleigh Park Locations Compared to Income Distribution in 2021 and Difference in Black and White Population Distribution in 2020,./media/RaleighParkLocationsComparedtoIncomeandDemo.png,,,"These figures display Raleigh Park locations compared to 2021 median household income and 2020 demographic data in Raleigh census tracts. The locations of Raleigh Park points and areas are shown overlayed on both figures. This provides visual insight into park locations compared to income and demograhics in Raleigh. From here, patterns and relationships can start to be formed; however, more detailed analysis is required to begin drawing conclusions",15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,,,,
4,4,Raleigh Park Kernel Density Analysis,./media/KernelDensity_IncomeandDemo.png,,,"These plots display kernel density analysis of park points in Raleigh. The result shows a dense cluster in the south/central area of Raleigh, which is downtown.",15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,,,geojson/NCSU_campuses.geojson,fillColor:red;color:black
5,5,Raleigh Demographics and Income Distribution Compared to Park Count and Density,./media/demo_income_park_count_and_density.png,,,"This figure displays 2020 Raliegh demographics, 2021 Raliegh Income, park count per census tract, and park density calcuated by park count of census tract/area of census tract. These plots allow better visualization of patterns and relationships between demographics, income, and park locations in Raliegh. The highest count and density of parks is located in downtown Raleigh. One apparent pattern is a high count and density of parks in south central Raleigh, which is in close proximity to areas of high income high white populations.",15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,,,,
6,6,Quality of Raliegh Parks,./media/RaleighParksimg.png,,,"What makes a park good or bad? It's difficult to qualify a parks value or quality because the purposes they serve are diverse. For example, a park could have hundreds of miles of walking trails around a park and another could have a carousel and amusement rides. Is one better than the other? For my project, I qualified parks based on their offering of basic ammenities such as playgrounds, restrooms, and picnic shelters with additional criteria to include the diverse offering of Raleigh Parks. Basics such as restrooms, playrounds, and picnic shelters provide services for a broad audience of park users and promote use and access.",15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,,,,
7,7,High Quality Park,./media/PullenPark.jpg,Only In Your State,https://www.onlyinyourstate.com/north-carolina/pullen-park-nc/,"Several criteria requirements were used to define a high quality park in my project. A park must have a playground, walking trail, dog park, picnic shell, and restrooms to be considered high quality. If it contains all of those plus other criteria such as a community center, camping options, pool, art center, etc. it can also be considered high quality. Pullen Park is a perfect example of a high quality park. It has amusement rides, water activities, walking paths, food, restrooms, playgrounds, tennis and athletic fields, and an arts, aquatic, and community center.",15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,,,,
8,8,Medium Quality Park,./media/JayceePark.png,Google Maps,,"Medium quality parks are comparable to high quality parks. One main difference is that medium parks aren't required to have walking trails like high quality parks are. If a park offers activies such as fishing, canoing, ballfields, or baseball on top of having a playground, dog park, picnic shell, and restrooms than it can be defined as a medium quality park. Jaycee Park in Raleigh was found to be a medium quality park, it has similar and even unique ammenties compared to Pullen Park; however, because it doesn't have walking trails it wasn't defined as high quality.",15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,,,,
9,9,Low Quality Park,./media/LowQualityParks.png,Google Maps,,"Low quality parks have very few ammenties and only offer limited activities. For example, a neighborhood park with only a playground and field or a small park with a few walking trails. They lack ammenities such as restrooms, which are critical for of high and medium quality parks. An important note to mention is that just becuase a low quality park doens't have certain attributes that a high or medium quality park would have it doesn't mean it has low use or value to its users. It is difficult to define quality as people will have differing views and desires for a park. My priority was to rank parks by the ammenities offered and remain objective in my qualification.",15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,,,,
