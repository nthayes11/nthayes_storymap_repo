0,0,Introduction,media/Intro_Image.jpg,John Chavis Memorial Park Source: This is Raleigh,https://thisisraleigh.com/parks-in-raleigh-nc/,"This storymap aims to investigate any relationships between park locations, household median income, and White and Black or African American population distributions in Raleigh census tracts. Raleigh has over 200 parks and Raleigh's Recreation and Cultural Resources Department's mission is to: establish and advance an equitable and inclusive community for all and to bring people to parks and parks to people! I hypothesize that there will be more parks and/or higher quality parks in primarily White or higher income census tracts within Raleigh, NC.",11.5,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.8167487,-78.6184176,,,./geojson/quality_of_parks_geojson.geojson,fillColor:green;color:black
1,1,Methods,,,,"<div style=""text-align: left;"">
    <ul>
        <li><b>Study Site:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>My project is focused on the City of Raleigh, which had a population of 467,425 in 2020 and has over 200 parks.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Data Collection:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>I used several datasets in my analysis. They consisted of Raleigh demographic data from the 2020 Decennial Census, 2021 Income data from the 2021 ACS 5-Year Estimates, as well as Raleigh Parks Point and Polygons layers, Raleigh City Limits, and Wake County Census Blocks all obtained from Raleigh Open Data.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Analysis:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>A) Attached demographic and income data to census blocks within Raleigh so that I could create a distribution map. B) Created a population difference map to visualize the distribution of White and Black or African American populations  in Raleigh as well as a map of income distribution C) Used kernel density analysis to display density contours of Raleigh park points. D) Created density maps of Raleigh census tracts displayed by park point count and park count per census tract area. E) Qualified parks by amenities and activities offered.</li>

2,2,Quality of Raleigh Parks,./media/RaleighParksimg.png,,,"What makes a park good or bad? It's difficult to qualify a parks value or quality because the purposes they serve are diverse. For example, a park could have hundreds of miles of walking trails around a park and another could have a carousel and amusement rides. Is one better than the other? For my project, I qualified parks based on their offering of basic amenities such as playgrounds, restrooms, and picnic shelters with additional criteria to include the diverse offering of Raleigh Parks. Basics such as restrooms, playgrounds, and picnic shelters provide services for a broad audience of park users and promote use and access.",12.0,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,,,,
3,3,High Quality Park,./media/PullenPark.jpg,Only In Your State,https://www.onlyinyourstate.com/north-carolina/pullen-park-nc/,"Several criteria requirements were used to define a high quality park in my project. A park must have a playground, walking trail, dog park, picnic shell, and restrooms to be considered high quality. If it contains all of those plus other criteria such as a community center, camping options, pool, art center, etc. it can also be considered high quality. Pullen Park is a perfect example of a high quality park. It has amusement rides, water activities, walking paths, food, restrooms, playgrounds, tennis and athletic fields, and an arts, aquatic, and community center.",15.75,Pullen Park,Green,"Raleigh, NC",35.7797091,-78.6617261,,,,
4,4,Medium Quality Park,./media/JayceePark.png,Google Maps,,"Medium quality parks are comparable to high quality parks. One main difference is that medium parks aren't required to have walking trails like high quality parks are. If a park offers activities such as fishing, canoeing, ballfields, or baseball on top of having a playground, dog park, picnic shell, and restrooms than it can be defined as a medium quality park. Jaycee Park in Raleigh was found to be a medium quality park, it has similar and even unique amenities compared to Pullen Park; however, because it doesn't have walking trails it wasn't defined as high quality.",15.75,Jaycee Park,Yellow,"Raleigh, NC",35.8003995,-78.6644208,,,,
5,5,Low Quality Park,./media/LowQualityParks.png,Google Maps,,"Low quality parks have very few amenities and only offer limited activities. For example, a neighborhood park with only a playground and field or a small park with a few walking trails. They lack amenities such as restrooms, which are critical for of high and medium quality parks. An important note to mention is that just because a low quality park doesnâ€™t have certain attributes that a high or medium quality park would have it doesn't mean it has low use or value to its users. It is difficult to define quality as people will have differing views and desires for a park. My priority was to rank parks by the amenities offered and remain objective in my qualification.",15.75,Brookhaven Nature Park,Red,"Raleigh, NC",35.8521721,-78.6867177,,,,

    <ul>
        <li>According to Larson & Hipp (2022), parks and green spaces 
        can be invaluable for mental and physical health</li>

        <li>Park accessibility for diverse communities should be a priority 
        for county and municipal governments</li>

        <li>The ability for people of all backgrounds to interact, play, and enjoy 
        the outdoors together is extremely valuable for health, connectedness, and social capital</li>

        <li>Park use should represent the community as a whole</li>
